There are many rituals that we either (i) know are bad for us, or (ii) a very high percentage of us dont want do do, but we still continue to do them, because of social norms: 

- Inane kids birthday parties (e.g. at a trampolene park) with pizza and juice. 
- Buying plastic junk, stickers, etc. on valentines to give your kids' classmates. 
- Candy on Halloween. 
- Eating cake on Birthdays and other occasions (we know sugar is bad for us). 
- Sweets on festivals. 

I believe these are a type 'coordination problem': if we had a way to signal to everyone else not to do it, without revealing that we are the ones suggesting that it not be done, then we might be able to make some progress. But nobody wants to be the first to suggest it. So how can we make progress? 

The coordination problem also arises when two countries are in a tense standoff and neither wants to back off, lest they appear weaker. The solution in this case is a neutral third party.
