I want to write about a curious phenomenon that I have experienced in myself, seen in others, and also read other people talk about - but I haven't yet seen it discussed scientifically, or been given a name. The mind likes to take the easy path. When faced with a difficult task -- difficult either because it requires prolonged focus or because it requires making an uncomfortable decision -- if there are other simpler tasks available, or districtions avialable, the mind likes to take up those side tasks. The reality however is that the value of engaging in long and slow difficult tasks is most often, much higher than doing 5-6 small tasks that would take the same amount of time -- the use of time is not directly proportional to the value added, i.e. much more value is unlocked from the long and difficult tasks. 

I have some hypotheses for why our mind likes to engage in this behavior: 

- the difficult task requires a lot more biological energy in terms of glucose.
- the mind has not yet evolved to focus on difficult tasks for prolonged periods, i.e. the older portions of our brains interrupt while the prefrontal cortex is trying to focus.
- there is a dopamine hit from accomplishing smaller but more trivial tasks. 
- we may have an evolutionary bias towards doing things that are quicker rather than long and slow because 'a predator might show up'.

All the ideas above indicate that we are in an evolutionary-mismatch situation, i.e. the present age is not what we are evolved for. So the question is, how do we avoid this trap? I think it begins by first acknowledging this problem, and then creating an environment where our brain is less likely to fall for the trap -- minimizing distractions (remove the smartphone from your workplace, or put it in do not disturb mode). Much has been written about this by Cal Newport, who advises us to do `deep work`, instead of several shallow tasks. 

I also suspect that another way to get better at doing the long and difficult tasks is to train the mind to do more of them with scheduled practice. In a way, this is what many forms of meditation are. But apart from meditation, another route is to engage in a creative activity that requires regular practice with sustained focus, for example playing the violing or piano. I suspect that for people who engage in these activities, overtime they get better at doing long and difficult tasks in other domains of their life. 

Another aspect of this problem is the existence of `backup options`. When making a big long term decision in our life, we like to create a backup option, for the case when the primary option doesn't work out. This is a risk-migitation strategy. However, it is possible that the existence of the backup option tricks our mind into not working hard enough to achieve the primary option. In recent times, I've heard several celebreties publicly talk about this phenomenon, often crediting their success to the lack of a backup option (Arnold Schwargennegger, Ronnie Screwvala come to mind).
