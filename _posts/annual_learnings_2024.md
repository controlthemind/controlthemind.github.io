I've turned 44. These are my learnings from the last year. 


- Overfitting is all around us. 
- Sohn-dickstein wrote a great post elucidating his Strong Version of Goodhart's Law. In it, we wish to optimize something but we cannot easily measure it or optimize it, so we instead optimize a related proxy that we can measure and optimize. Initially, optimizing the proxy also improves the thing we actually care about. But after optimizing this proxy repeatedly, we begin to ultimately stop making progress at improving our true objective and in fact can begin to get worse at it. This is an extremely general phenomenon. 
- Sohl-dickstein provides several examples of where this applies in the real world, outside of machine learning. 
- In this post, I will add a few more areas where I believe this type of overfitting is happeneing. 
- I also pose the question of how we can ideantify that we may be in an overfitting regime, and try to answer it. 
- I also posit that as we transition from childhood to young adulthood, we may be in an environment that is so inured to optimizing the proxy that we may not even be aware of the true underlying object that the proxy is trying to optimize. I posit that becoming aware of underlying goals as separate from the proxies, requires careful consideration and contemplation. 
- I bring out the connection between the topic of overfitting and that of adaptation in Darwinian evolution, in the context of a changing world, and from the perspective of a migrant. 

- Capitalism as a way of organizing society
  - Objective: maximize value
  - Proxy: maximize wealth
  - Result: With overoptimization for wealth, value can suffer drastically. Some examples: 
- Socialism as a way of organizing society
- Healthcare
- Education
- Earning money
- Food
  - The human body has adapted or 'overfit' to a byegone evolutionary era of scarcity. 
  - Objective: nutrition. 
  - Proxy: taste.
  - Result: food companies exploit this overfit by selling us things that taste good but don't add much nutrition. 
- The human brain
  - Objecive: survival
  - Proxy: risk-adjusted survival, with extremely poor estimation of risk. 
- Interviewing
  - Objective: determine if this candidate do well in the job
  - Proxy: determine if the candidate does well in the interview
  - Result: Candidates and prep companies overfit to the interview. 
- College and admissions: 
  - Objective: select hard working students that will bring repute to their alma mater via their accomplishments. 
  - proxy: Looks for great resume traits like 'started a company in high school', 'taught english in africa' etc. 
  - result: students spend their school years shaping their resumes. 
- Money: 
  - Money is a medium of exchange that serves as a proxy for value
  - objective: maximize value
  - Proxy: maximize money
  - Result: products and services that are the most expensive are not necessarily the ones that offer most value. Companies know this and sometimes signal that they are selling a high value product simply by raising its price - this fools some customers. Jobs that ave the highest pay are not necessarily adding the most value. 
- Overfitting in nature: evolution by natural selection is a type of optimization. It optimizes the survival odds of the members of a species in the environment they are. What is the proxy and what is the true objective? 

- How can we detect that we are in an overfitting regime? The classical way to do this is to evaluate the the true objective from time to time apart from just the proxy, while optimizing the proxy. If there is a large gap between the quality of the true objective, and the proxy, or if the proxy has been on an improving trajectory, but the true objective has been getting worse, then we are overfitting. 

- How can we figure out the extent of alignment betweeen an objective and its proxy? 

- Is there a double descent? 

More learnings: 

-- Where do we derive value from? i.e. how do we come up with our subjective notion that something is valuable? I think the root lies deep in our upbringing - if we have learnt that a certain person is to be respected, or a certain type of person (e.g. a great sports person, or an actor is great), then the things that such a person does becomes valuable to us, by association. I think kids are easily influenced by this, but grown up are obviously not safe from this either -- it is the basis of a large fraction of ads. 

-- The idea of the self: who we think we are is derived from what we think others around us think we are. This idea traces back to... It is a powerful and very often true idea. So much so that I think sometimes we act in ways to make other people think a specific thing about us, just so that we can have that view of ourselves. 

-- The concept of sin in Hindu philosophy is different from the concept of sin in western philosophy. In the latter, the focus is on an action that violates the will of god, while in the former, the focus is on an act that hurts our self (which in Hindu philosophy, is the soul), such that it drives us further into llusion about our true self. 

-- Knowing oneself is a central theme of pschological maturity, and therefore of growing up. I would like my children to develop this as early as possible. Knowing who you are (and who you are not) is 

-- religion and philosphy are models: of human behavior. And there fore are prone to overfitting

-- Goals for 2025: keeping health in check and stiling the mind. Starting or joining a club.
