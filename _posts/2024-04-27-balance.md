The Anna Karenina principle is based on the opening line of Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, “All happy families are all alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. This principle has been applied to several domains. I want to reflect on this in light of an observation, namely that in order to live a sustainable, successful, happy life, we need to balance 5 things: 

- Healthy professional life
- Healthy family life
- Healthy social life
- Mental Health
- Physical Health 

In a sense, we must juggle each of these 5 balls constantly, needing to attend to any of these areas that is being neglected. In order to excell at world class level in any of these spheres, it is often necessary do so at the cost of neglecting some o the other spheres, especially if this success it to come very quickly -- I believe this is the reason we sometimes see celebreties and world-famous people in some spheres burn out and fall. If we drop any of these balls too much, it is going to bring the other 4 balls down too. Let me explain: 

- If we do poorly in the professional sphere, it can affect our earnings and our self-confidence. These things can make us stressed (mental health). Poor mental health ultimately impacts physical health (and vice-versa). Financial stress can damage family life, as well as dampen social interactions. 
- If we neglect our family, this will eventually lead to dissatisfaction from our family members and a feel of being disconnected from our loved ones. Ultimately, this wil affect our mental health, which then affects physical health. Social life gets affected too because one cannot give more time to social life if one is neglecting one's family. Ultimately, all of this worsens our focus at work, which worsens the quality of professional life. 
- Similarly, neglecting social life amkes life too monotonous and disconnected form the people around us -- ultimately this starts to affect mental health. 
- The connection between physical and mental health is the most interesting to me. If we don't take of our physical health by regular exercise, this produces real biological changes in our body in the form of hormones or the lack thereof, which can over time worse our mental health. Similarly, if we are in a poor mental state, such as when we are chronically stressed, we tend to not eat healty, and often the stress manifests as a pain in some part of the body (for e.g. Tension Myosytis Syndrome). So there is a clear link between physical and mental health.
