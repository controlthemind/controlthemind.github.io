This blog is based on the following hypothesis: almost all forms of culture that have been passed to humanity over the generations, are meant to encode information to help us overcome our lack of control over our own mind. Or rather the portion of our mind that is evolutionarilty primitive. This includes music, food, dance, the visual arts, meditation, and all of religion and spirituality. Below, I describe in detail what I mean by this, why I have a strong bent towards this hypothesis, and why I'm looking to share this with the world. 

- The human brain is a complex machine. It has evolved over millions of years. We now know that is consists of multiple parts: the part that has evolved most recently, is called the prefrontal cortex, which is capable of logical and scientific reasoning. There are also parts that evolved in a different era - when we were not exactly Homo Sapiens. These are the limic brain and the reptilian brain. These latter parts are more reactionary, emotional and instinctive - in other words, they are animalistic, and they represent the animalistic portion of human identity. 

- In the present day, the older, more primitive portions of our brain are less relevant, and the newer pre-frontal cortex is increaingly more relevant. Yet, we cannot easily get rid of the older portions of our brain - they contrinue to exercise an influence in our day to day behaviors, often even when it is better for us to use our prefrontal cortex, it is the older brains that decide on our behalf. This is frequently a result of mismatch between the environmet that we evolutionarily evolved for (forests, hunter-gatherer societies, the threat of predators, close-knit tribes, danger at every turn) and the environment most of us live in today (secure apartments/houses, industrial and knowledge-based work, no threat of predators, increasing social isolation, and massive abundance and technology resources).   

- A lot has been written on the topic of how our brains work:
	- In the 1950s, [Paul MacLean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_D._MacLean) proposed the [Triune theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain) of the brain, which has since been [criticized / debunked](https://medicine.yale.edu/news/yale-medicine-magazine/article/a-theory-abandoned-but-still-compelling/), but still provides an insights. The Triune theory is the idea that the 3 parts of the brain operate relatively independently, namely the Prefrontal-neocortex (rational part), the limbic brain (emotional), and the reptilian complex (basal ganglia). 
	- Psychologists Keith Stanovich and Richard West first published the terms "System 1" and "System 2" in 1999. Stanovich's 2000 book Thinking, Fast and Slow popularized the terms, which differentiate between two modes of thought: system 1 being fast, instinctive, emotional and system 2 being slow, deliberate, logical. 
        - Many humans over the course of history have proposed mechanisms to prevent our ancient brains from taking over when it is the newer brain that we should be using. Many cultures have independently come up with forms of meditation -- for example Vipassana meditation is based on observing one's breath, and even as it repeatedly wanders away, one must gently bring it back to the breath. In this exercise, who is it that wanders away and who is it that realizes the wandering?

- Despite the large volume of research into brain structure and functioning, I believe we still have only rudimentary knowledge of how our brain works. 

- By focusing on trying to achieve excellence in whatever it is we do, we can silence the chatter of our brains. 

- In this blog we explore aspects of medieval and ancient cultural heritage through the lens of this idea - that the ultimate purpose of key elements of cultural heritage is to enable descendents to realize the goal of silencing the mind, thereby controling it, and ultimately, using this elevated state to achieve difficult feats for the benefit of humanity. I believe this is the true meaning of the sanskrit term 'Yoga'.
