This blog is based on the following hypothesis: almost all forms of culture that have been passed to humanity over the generations, are meant to encode information to help us overcome our lack of control over our own mind. Or rather the portion of our mind that is evolutionarilty primitive. This includes music, food, dance, the visual arts, meditation, and all of religion and spirituality. Below, I describe in detail what I mean by this, why I have a strong bent towards this hypothesis, and why I'm looking to share this with the world. 

- The human brain is a complex machine. It has evolved over millions of years. We now know that is consists of multiple parts: the part that has evolved most recently, is called the prefrontal cortex, which is capable of logical and scientific reasoning. There are also parts that evolved in a different era - when we were not exactly Homo Sapiens. These are the limic brain and the reptilian brain. These latter parts are more reactionary, emotional and instinctive - in other words, they are animalistic, and they represent the animalistic portion of human identity. 

- In the present day, the older, more primitive portions of our brain are less relevant, and the newer pre-frontal cortex is increaingly more relevant. Yet, we cannot easily get rid of the older portions of our brain - they contrinue to exercise an influence in our day to day behaviors, often even when we logically know that we'd rather use our prefrontal cortex, it is the older brains that decide on our behalf. 

- A lot has been written on this topic: 
-- X proposed the Triune theory of the brain, which has since been criticized / debunked, but still provides an insights.
-- Many humans over the course of history have proposed mechanisms to prevent our ancient brains from taking over when it is the newer brain that we should be using. For example, many cultures have independently come up with forms of meditation -- such as observing one's breath, or observing one's thoughts. 
-- Kahneman and Tversky proposed the idea of System 1 and System 1 thinking.
