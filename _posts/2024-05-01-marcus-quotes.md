It was the birthday of Marcus Aurelius recently, and so, it is fitting that we celebrate by examining some of his prominent quotes: 

> “It is not death that one should fear, but never beginning to live.”


> “You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.”


> “Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.”


> “Your mind will take the shape of what you frequently hold in thought, for the human spirit is colored by such impressions.”


> “Do not indulge in dreams of having what you have not, but reckon up the chief of the blessings you do possess, and then thankfully remember how you would crave for them if they were not yours.”

This is an important one. It can be interpreted to mean tha the emperor was using this as a clever device to control his people -- by telling them to be satisfied with what they have -- and so, perhaps Stocism is a social control device against ambitious people who would otherwise question authority and demand more from those that rule over them. But this is not the interpretation that I subscribe to, perhaps because there is something here that overlaps with the message of the Bhagawad Gita (which incidentally, can also be taken to be a social control device too). My interpretation of this quote is that it is not asking us for inaction, or not striving to achieve. Rather it is offering a psychological trick -- professor William Irvine, in his book A guide ot the Good life explains this technique as 'negative visualization', a way to avoid the hedonic treadmill that almost all of us walk on. The hedonic treadmill is our mind adapting to the better conditions and more resources, not finding them novel any longer, and then hankering for more. Negative visualization, as explained in Aurelius' quote above can literally allow us us, by closing our eyes and imagining that the things we value are taken away from us, to continue to cherish them in our lives, and thereby practice a form of gratitude. 


> “How much more grievous are the consequences of anger than the causes of it.”


> “The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injury.”


> “We love ourselves above all others, yet we put more stock in other people’s opinions of us than in our own.”


> “You always have the option of having no opinion. There is never any need to get worked up or to trouble your soul about things you can't control. These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.”


> “Think of the life you have lived until now as over and, as a dead person, see what’s left as a bonus and live it accordingly.”
