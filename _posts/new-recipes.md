I would like to start a contest. The idea is to develop new healthier receipes to replace cherished traditional foods, in order to make them more consistent with modern understanding of nutrition science. The reason that this is a hard problem is two fold: changing parts of a culture raises eyebrows (and rightly so, in my view) because it can be seen as the first step in the destruction of a culture. Second, the taste of traditional foods is associated with childhood memories, which makes it hard to move away from them. 

**Sugar** is the number one target in this campaign, and also the most formidable enemy. It appears in a dizzying array traditional foods in many cultures around the world. On Indian festivals, there is invariably a sweet laden with sugar. Doing away with traditional sweets is triply hard - apart from the two reasons above, sugar is also a highly addictive substance.
