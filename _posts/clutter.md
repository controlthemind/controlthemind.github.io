Clutter can be defined as that which prevents us from stilling our mind to the extent needed to feel the need for, and eventually achieve self-actualization. The sources of clutter in our minds: 

- Real fears based on survival: Food, clothing, shelter, security - first for the self, and then for one's loved ones. 
- Fears that are exaggerated: Fear of landing up on the street despite having sufficient savings.
- Social stress: Fear of not being liked and respected by others. 
- External media: Television, print, social media.
