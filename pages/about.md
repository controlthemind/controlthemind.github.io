**About this blog**

This blog is loosely based on a realization I had in 2023. To describe this realization I first need to mention a bit of background information: 

- Our mind is contantly chattering, accepting and rejecting, theorizing, imagining, debating with itself. It is difficult to focus the mind, to calm it down.

- The few times that we are able to focus the mind, we achieve an exceptional level of clarity, at times we attain a state of flow, whereing we lose perception of time, even perception of the self. 

- A large body of culture has been transmitted down human generations, covering a number of different realms: music, dance, art, spiritual traditions. Following these traditions to a high level of perfection requires a level of discipline that stils the mind. 

With this background in mind, in 2023 I came to the following interpretation of culture: the ultimate purpose of a large part of culture that has survived across centuries and generations is to still the mind, one in which we are unperturbed by highs and lows. And further, that the ultimate purpose of attaining this state of mind is self-actualization, i.e. the enablement of each individual to realize, cultivate, and enact their purpose. I take this to be the highest ideal of human life. I believe the great teachers in any form of cultures, who have themselves realized this, have encoded this information in 'culture' which is then transmitted to the future, as a gift to help other humans realize their own stillness and thereby self-actualize.
