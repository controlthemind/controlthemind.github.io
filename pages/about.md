**About this blog**

This blog is loosely based on a realization I had in 2023. To describe this realization I first need to mention a bit of background information: 

- Our mind is contantly chattering, accepting and rejecting, theorizing, imagining, debating with itself. It is difficult to focus the mind, to calm it down.

- The few times that we are able to focus the mind, we achieve an exceptional level of clarity, at times we attain a state of flow, whereing we lose perception of time, even perception of the self. 

- A large body of culture has been transmitted down human generations, covering a number of different realms: music, dance, art, spiritual traditions. Following these traditions to a high level of perfection requires a level of discipline that stils the mind. 

With this background in mind, in 2023 I came to the following interpretation of culture: the ultimate purpose of a large part of culture that has survived across centuries and generations is to still the mind, one in which we are unperturbed by highs and lows. And further, that the ultimate purpose of attaining this state of mind is (Maslow's) self-actualization, i.e. the enablement of each individual to realize, cultivate, and enact their purpose. I take this to be the highest ideal of human life. I believe that great teachers from all traditions, who have themselves realized this, have encoded this information in 'culture' which is then transmitted to the future, as a gift to help other humans realize their own stillness and thereby self-actualize. 

I have yet to reach the aforementioned state, but here are some causes that I care deeply about -- if you have an interest in any of these, or would like to chat, please drop me a line:

- Proliferation of Indian classical music, both Carnatic and Hindustani. 
- Rapid low cost development of medicines for major diseases. 
- Basic economics education starting at the primary + secondary school level. 
- Revision of traditional practices that conflict with modern science, without losing culture. For example, many cultures celebrates with sugar-laden sweets of various kinds. While sugar was a rare and expensive substance in the ancient past, it is not so anymore, and we now know the many health problems associated with consumption of sugar. I would like to change such traditional practices in ways that make them more consistent with modern science, without complete loss of ancient culture. In my observation, thisis already happeneing in bits and pieces. 
- More accessible information on controlling one's mind to laypeople, including children, and the creation of daily cultural norms to inculcate focus and mindfulness. I feel modern sources of distraction, particularly relating to 'screens, social media and passive consumption of content' need to be battled using a sumliminal form of counter-propaganda, which requires the creation of new daily rituals (e.g. morning meditation, blocked evening time for no-screen family time) as cultural artifacts.  
- More accessible meantal health.
- Improving awareness of person health, diet and fitness among common people across the world.
